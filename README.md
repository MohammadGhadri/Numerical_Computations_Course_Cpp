# Numerical_Computations_Course
I did a few projects for the Numerical Computations course using C++. Project’s title: Formula modelling and solving relevant issues by using Visual Studio Software.

The projects' source code are provided and the subject are:
  1. Root-Finding:
    1.1. Bracketing Methods
    1.2. Interpolation Method
    1.3. Newton's Method
  2. Lagrange polynomials
  3. Regression Analysis
  4. Numerical integration:
    4.1. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Simpson's Rule
    4.2. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Composite Trapezoid Rule
    4.3. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Composite Simpson's Rule
