# Numerical Computations Course
I did a few projects for the Numerical Computations course using C++.

The projects' source code are provided and the subject are:
  1. Root-Finding:
    1.1. Bracketing Methods
    1.2. Interpolation Method
    1.3. Newton's Method
  3. Lagrange polynomials
  4. Regression Analysis
  5. Numerical integration:
    4.1. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Simpson's Rule
    4.2. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Composite Trapezoid Rule
    4.3. Closed Newton–Cotes Formula Composite Simpson's Rule
